please make sure that the RFID scanner and the usb relay
are both connected to the bottom row of usb ports. 

Typically I will connect the RFID scanner to the bottom-left USB port
and the USB Relay on the bottom-right.

Please also connect a USB mouse / keyboard-trackpad to any available USB port.

To install the project, import the zip file into the raspberry pi
and unzip its in this folder:
/home/pi

There will be a file called Turnstile, move or copy this file to the Desktop.
You will need to click on this file to launch the program on the raspberry pi.
If prompted, please click on "Execute in Terminal"

The Turnstile file will launch two functions simultaneously (storage.py and exit.py)

The entry.pi function can be run on any other computer currently on the same wireless network
You will also need the allmyfunctions.pi file in the same folder in order for the file to work
To run, either double-click, or right click and run, or use the command prompt

To run the turnstile on raspberry pi, please make sure that the RFID reader and Relay are connected
Then launch the program using the Turnstile file.

To exit the turnstile program, press escape on a connected keyboard.
You can just shut down the raspberry pi by powering off, but I would not recommend that.
